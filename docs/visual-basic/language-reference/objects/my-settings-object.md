# <a name="mysettings-object"></a>My.Settings Nesnesi
Provides properties and methods for accessing the application's settings.  
  
## <a name="remarks"></a>Açıklamalar  
 The `My.Settings` object provides access to the application's settings and allows you to dynamically store and retrieve property settings and other information for your application. For more information, see [Managing Application Settings (.NET)](/visualstudio/ide/managing-application-settings-dotnet).  
  
## <a name="properties"></a>Özellikler  
 The properties of the `My.Settings` object provide access to your application's settings. To add or remove settings, use the **Settings Designer**.  
  
 Each setting has a **Name**, **Type**, **Scope**, and **Value**, and these settings determine how the property to access each setting appears in the `My.Settings` object:  
  
- **Name** determines the name of the property.  
  
- **Type** determines the type of the property.  
  
- **Scope** indicates if the property is read-only. If the value is **Application**, the property is read-only; if the value is **User**, the property is read-write.  
  
- **Value** is the default value of the property.  
  
## <a name="methods"></a>Yöntemler  
  
|Yöntem|Açıklama|  
|---|---|  
|`Reload`|Reloads the user settings from the last saved values.|  
|`Save`|Saves the current user settings.|
