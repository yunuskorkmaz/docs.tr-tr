# <a name="playing-sounds-visual-basic"></a>Ses Çalma [Visual Basic]

The `My.Computer.Audio` object provides methods for playing sounds.  
  
## <a name="playing-sounds"></a>Ses Çalma  

 Background playing lets the application execute other code while the sound plays. The `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method allows the application to play only one background sound at a time; when the application plays a new background sound, it stops playing the previous background sound. You can also play a sound and wait for it to complete.  
  
 In the following example, the `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method plays a sound. When `AudioPlayMode.WaitToComplete` is specified, `My.Computer.Audio.Play` waits until the sound completes before calling code continues. When using this example, you should ensure that the file name refers to a .wav sound file that is on your computer

 In the following example, the `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method plays a sound. When using this example, you should ensure that the application resources include a .wav sound file that is named Waterfall.

## <a name="playing-looping-sounds"></a>Playing Looping Sounds  

 In the following example, the `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method plays the specified sound in the background when `PlayMode.BackgroundLoop` is specified. When using this example, you should ensure that the file name refers to a .wav sound file that is on your computer.  
  
 [!code-vb[VbVbalrMyComputer#11](~/samples/snippets/visualbasic/VS_Snippets_VBCSharp/VbVbalrMyComputer/VB/Class1.vb#11)]  
  
 In the following example, the `My.Computer.Audio.Play` method plays the specified sound in the background when `PlayMode.BackgroundLoop` is specified. When using this example, you should ensure that the application resources include a .wav sound file that is named Waterfall.

 The preceding code example is also available as an IntelliSense code snippet. In the code snippet picker, it is located in **Windows Forms Applications > Sound**. For more information, see [Code Snippets](/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets).  
  
 In general, when an application plays a looping sound, it should eventually stop the sound.  
  
## <a name="stopping-the-playing-of-sounds-in-the-background"></a>Stopping the Playing of Sounds in the Background  

 Use the `My.Computer.Audio.Stop` method to stop the application's currently playing background or looping sound.  
  
 In general, when an application plays a looping sound, it should stop the sound at some point.  
  
 The following example stops a sound that is playing in the background.

## <a name="playing-system-sounds"></a>Playing System Sounds  

 Use the `My.Computer.Audio.PlaySystemSound` method to play the specified system sound.  
  
 The `My.Computer.Audio.PlaySystemSound` method takes as a parameter one of the shared members from the <xref:System.Media.SystemSound> class. The system sound <xref:System.Media.SystemSounds.Asterisk%2A> generally denotes errors.  
  
 The following example uses the `My.Computer.Audio.PlaySystemSound` method to play a system sound.
