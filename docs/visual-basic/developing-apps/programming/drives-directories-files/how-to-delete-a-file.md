 Aşağıdaki koşullar özel bir duruma neden olabilir:  
  
- The path is not valid for one of the following reasons: it is a zero-length string, it contains only white space, it contains invalid characters, or it is a device path (starts with \\\\.\\) (<xref:System.ArgumentException>).  
  
- The path is not valid because it is `Nothing` (<xref:System.ArgumentNullException>).  
  
- The path exceeds the system-defined maximum length (<xref:System.IO.PathTooLongException>).  
  
- A file or folder name in the path contains a colon (:) or is in an invalid format (<xref:System.NotSupportedException>).  
  
- The file is in use (<xref:System.IO.IOException>).  
  
- The user lacks necessary permissions to view the path (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).  
  
- The file does not exist (<xref:System.IO.FileNotFoundException>).  
  
- The user does not have permission to delete the file, or the file is read-only (<xref:System.UnauthorizedAccessException>).  
  
- A partial-trust situation exists in which the user does not have sufficient permissions (<xref:System.Security.SecurityException>).  
  
- The user cancelled the operation and `onUserCancel` is set to `ThrowException` (<xref:System.OperationCanceledException>).
