# <a name="service-security-validation-and-authentication-failures"></a>Hizmet: Güvenlik Doğrulama ve Kimlik Doğrulama Hataları
Counter name: Security Validation and Authentication Failures  
  
## <a name="description"></a>Açıklama  
 This counter is incremented whenever a message is rejected due to a security problem not covered by the "Security Calls Not Authorized" counter. Such problems include:  
  
- Client token cannot be read from the message.  
  
- Client token has failed authentication (for example, bad password).  
  
- Signature verification has failed (for example, the message has been tampered).  
  
- The message is a duplicate from a previous one, which can happen during a replay attack.  
  
- A decryption failure has occurred.  
  
- Some required elements (for example, missing timestamp or encrypted data block) are missing from the message.  
  
- Errors have occurred during TLSNEGO/SPNEGO handshake.
